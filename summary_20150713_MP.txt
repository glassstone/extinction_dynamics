Hi all, I read the Vieira paper again and I think we can definitely do something interesting based on the proposed model

I wrote a short summary and a few ideas

- They propose an extinction "model" based on network topology (does not explicitly includes dynamics)
- In previous studies simulating extinctions:
    - coextinction required the loss of all partners
    - interaction strengths were not taken into account (a species can survive with one partner with whom it interacts weakly)
    - Variation on how species depend on their partners was ignored
- The authors propose a stochastic model that
    1. incorporates variation in dependences
    2. relaxes the assumption that coextinction requires the loss of all interaction partners
- Under the proposed model the dependence of species on the interactions controls the likelihood of extinction cascades and highly connected networks are more susceptible to cascades
- The model is more realistic since it considers the possibility of compensatory effects

The model:

- let Pij = Ri dij be the probability of species i going extinct following the extinction of a mutualistic partner species j
- dij is the population-level strength of the interaction
- Ri is assumed constant for each species and reflects the intrinsic demographic dependence of species i on the mutualism in question
- Simulations proceed by removing one species at a given trophic level, and removing species from the other set according to P
- dij are recalculated after each extinction

Where to go from here?

1. In the original work a single value of R is considered for the entire network. This is unrealistic. Different species depend on the interaction with different degrees. This R could also be seen as the participation of the species in a particular network. For instance, if we are studying a frugivory network species that eat insects, but are also included in the network will have smaller R than strict frugivores. Similarly, a species that feed on fruits that we are considering but also on other fruits that, for some reason, are not included in this particular network, has smaller R.  Thus, the R parameter is what defines the boundaries of the network. It would be interesting to perform simulation where R obeys a probability distributions. How different R distributions changes the size and shape of extinction cascades? Are there critical points given by the parameters of these distributions?

2. The authors only explored mutualisms. It would be interesting to test whether their conclusions hold for other interaction types

3. One of the possibilities we discussed was testing the effects of extinction on multilayered networks. This would be the obvious step after step 1. We could start from the simple scenario with 2 interaction types (e.g. mutualism, herbivory) and then explore other combinations. An empirical system that we could play with are defensive mutualisms for which I believe Cecilia might have suitable data.

4. Since the model was designed thinking on mutualisms one extinction can only have negative effects over the partners. However when we think on antagonisms (competition, predation, parasitism), extinctions may favor other species. Since the model is probabilistic, we could also have, Q, which is the probability of density increase after an extinction. P could also change if antagonists increased enough in abundance. we should discuss the feasibility of adding this to the model while keeping it simple.


Next steps:

- In the next months I'll play with the R codes in the Supporting information and try to devise an alternate model encompassing option 4 above.

@jimmy: I would happily write a report about the extinction project (as you guys asked in the email), but as I told you I will have limited internet access next week

I hope this brainstorm will help

2. The second step is to think how we can generalize this to antagonist interactions. In antagonistic interactions the loss of a prey species may have a demographic impact on the predator, but the loss of the predator can have a positive impact on the prey - We need to discuss how to generalize the same model to include these possibilities


Pij = Rij x dij , if i is a predator

Qij = Rij x dji, if i is a prey species -> probability that i increases in density

if the density increases we could have one iteration step where interaction frequencies are changed by some factor - assuming that population density affects interaction frequencies



A. response of model output to probabilistic values of R
B. behavior of model on non-mutualistic interactions
C. merge multiple networks using multi-layer network approach (perhaps very difficult)
