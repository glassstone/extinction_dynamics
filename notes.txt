# 1 - How different distributions of R facilitate or buffer extinction cascades?

- Pick the trophic level of the initial extinction at random

- pick the species for extinction on the basis of:
  - abundance
  - R
  - specialization
  - degree
  - something else? See Memmott 2004 for motivation

- analyze and plot:
  - cascade degree and frequency
    as a function of:
  - initial species traits


# 2. How is the disassembly process under different R distributions after the loss of important species?
- For all simulations
  - either keep all networks along the way, or 
    make calculations to be kept along the way

  2.1 analyze and plot:
  - topological properties
    as a function of:
  - timestep
    accounting for differences in initial species properties
    
  ??? This will produce a bunch of lines; what analysis? time of first collapse?

  2.2 analyze and plot:
  - species' trait over time degree, strength
    as a function of:
  - timestep
    accounting for differences in initial species properties

  2.3 analyze and plot (sensitivity analysis?)
  - disassembly trajectory
    as a function of 
  - rank of initial species lost

# 3. test on empirical distributions of R
  - what are the expected distributions of R in different interactions/habitats
  - search for empirical data of R distribution
  - test on empirical distributions of R
